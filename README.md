# sha-words

A clojure program to turn a sha hash into list of nouns in a predictable jar.

## Usage

### Java versoin
```
$ java -jar sha-words.jar b67d6eafeae1d5a424a609864fad10665453afa5
```

### Babashka version

```
$ ./sha-words.bb
```

### Note about shas:

Actually any hex number should work fine. It happens to be optimized for 64bits.

## Example

```
$ git rev-parse HEAD
5379784cf5f6ebf5cc62cf8b9972870bb4e42c05

$ git rev-parse HEAD | xargs ./sha-words.bb
observation-obedient-bedroom-sweet-electric
```

## Building

### Requirements

You'll need clojure and babashka, however you can build either version only if
you prefer.

```
make
```

This requires babashka to build the babaska version.

You can restrict the build to the uberjar: `make uberjar`
